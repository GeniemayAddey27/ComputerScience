# Boolean expressions
# kind of like a math formula
# 14 + 10 = 24    algebra uses arithemtic operators
 # can only evaluate to true or false
# 5 > 10 = false     Boolean Algebre uses comparison operators
# > < <=

print(4+10)  #Algebra
print(5>10) #Boolean ALgebra

x = 5    # SET x equal to five, tell it what to be

print(x == 5) # GET x equals 5, asl a question

#This is the perfect test question
# What is the difference between = and ==

print(4 >= 2)  # True
print (19993 == 19993)  #True
print(-90 < -99)  #False
print( 10 != 10)  #False "not"
